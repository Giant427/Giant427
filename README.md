14 year-old game developer rookie, with the confidence of being on top of the leaderboard, and determination off the charts. I am a programmer with nearly 3 years of experience (just a few months off 3 years).
I am really into shooter games. It's just in my genes, I have been playing shooter games since I was 8 years old (some multi-player and some single-player).
