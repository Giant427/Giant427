It's me, hi! I am 16 year-old student in India.
I am looking forward to my career path with computers all the way.
I like playing video games, listening to music and doing both while enjoying a cup of coffee.

I have the ability to code in JavaScript, Lua, Python, and C++.
- [INTERMEDIATE] JavaScript for web development and Node.js
- [ADVANCED] Lua when I was just getting into programming with game development on Roblox
- [BEGINNER] C++ for Unreal Engine 5
- [INTERMEDIATE] Python in school

I have nearly 3 years of experience developing on Roblox.
I generally love competitive games, and shooter games are kinda my thing.
Besides violence I also like racing games.

I was learning programming from Udemy courses and YouTube videos.
Lua was the first programming language I learned at around 13 years old.
Started reading more and more stuff on the Devforum.
I was even working for free just to learn more stuff and gain experience.

Some of my (very old) projects on Roblox:
